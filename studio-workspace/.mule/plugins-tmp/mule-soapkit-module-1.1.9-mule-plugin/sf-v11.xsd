<!--

<faultcode>
The <faultcode> element is a mandatory element in the <Fault> element. It provides information about
the fault in a form that can be processed by software. SOAP defines a small set of SOAP fault codes
covering basic SOAP faults, and this set can be extended by applications.

<faultstring>
The <faultstring> element is a mandatory element in the <Fault> element.
It provides information about the fault in a form intended for a human reader.

<faultactor>
The <faultactor> element contains the URI of the SOAP node that generated the fault.
A SOAP node that is not the ultimate SOAP receiver must include the <faultactor> element when it creates a fault.
An ultimate SOAP receiver is not obliged to include this element, but may do so.

<detail>
The <detail> element carries application-specific error information related to the <Body> element.
It must be present if the contents of the <Body> element were not successfully processed. It must not be
used to carry information about error information belonging to header entries. Detailed error information belonging to header
entries must be carried in header entries.
